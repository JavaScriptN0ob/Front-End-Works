# Front-End-Works

1. Validation animation and functions 80% finished, and could use normally.
2. Recaptcha System is still in progress, currently could not send me the email due to the recaptcha problem.
3. Jumping/Vibrating animation on validation form after clicking submit button is little bit tracky to me now, may work on it later.
4. Rotating animation between pages is my next target to deal with, please give it a time.
