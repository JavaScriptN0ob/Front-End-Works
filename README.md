# Front-End-Works

1. Validation animation and functions 80% finished, and could use normally.
    - Validation functions had been finished.
2. Recaptcha System is still in progress, currently could not send me the email due to the recaptcha problem.
    - ReCaptCha system V2 from Google had been add to the contact page, but due to I do not have a https address, so currently it could not work properly.
3. Jumping/Vibrating animation on validation form after clicking submit button is little bit tracky to me now, may work on it later.
4. Rotating animation between pages is my next target to deal with, please give it a time.
    - Finding JS library to solve 3&4, but looks not that good. Due to all codes in this project is written by myself without coping, so I decided to ignore 3&4 for a little bit longer.
